# GPT-2 Implementation Summary

## ✅ **What I've Implemented**

### **1. Real GPT-2 Text Generation**
- **Custom GPT-2 Tokenizer**: Simple BPE tokenizer with 50K+ vocabulary
- **Autoregressive Generation**: Token-by-token generation using the actual 645MB model
- **Proper Inference Pipeline**: Input preprocessing, model prediction, output decoding
- **Fallback System**: Gracefully falls back to enhanced templates if GPT-2 fails

### **2. Authentic Template System Overhaul**
- **Realistic Templates**: `"ugh need groceries... 20 minutes later still thinking about it"`
- **Casual Language**: Lowercase, fragments, stream-of-consciousness
- **Real Daily Life**: Work stress, commute, family calls, procrastination
- **Fragment-based Generation**: Time jumps, casual connectors, authentic voice

### **3. Custom Entry Testing System**
- **File Import**: Import text files with your own journal prompts
- **Multi-Mode Testing**: Test same prompt across Templates/Core ML/Hybrid
- **Reality Level Testing**: Different AI behavior at different reality settings
- **Bulk Processing**: Process multiple prompts automatically

## 🧪 **What You Should Test Next**

### **Immediate Testing (5 minutes)**
1. **Open Gaslight app**
2. **Go to Settings → Testing**
3. **Test the new authentic Templates mode:**
   - Set AI mode to "Templates Only"  
   - Tap "Generate Test Entry" 5 times
   - Notice the casual, messy, realistic voice vs old formal entries

### **GPT-2 Core ML Testing (10 minutes)**
4. **Test actual GPT-2 generation:**
   - Set AI mode to "Core ML Only"
   - Tap "Load GPT-2 Model" (wait 10-30 seconds)
   - Tap "Generate Test Entry" 5 times
   - **Key difference**: GPT-2 should produce more coherent, flowing text vs template fragments

### **Custom Prompt Testing (10 minutes)**
5. **Create a test file** `my_prompts.txt` with content like:
   ```
   Today I woke up feeling
   Work was stressful because
   I tried to cook dinner but
   My mom called to check on me
   The commute home was
   ```
6. **Import and test:**
   - Tap "Import Custom Test Prompts" → select your file
   - Tap "Test All AI Modes with Custom Prompts"
   - Check Entries tab to see how each AI mode handled your prompts

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### **Templates Mode** (should feel human)
- Lowercase, casual language: "spent too much time on my phone. no regrets"
- Real daily struggles: commute, work, family
- Fragment-based: "...honestly still processing this"

### **Core ML Mode** (should feel AI-like but coherent)  
- Longer, flowing sentences
- More philosophical/introspective tone
- Better grammar and structure
- **If it fails**: Falls back to templates with a delay

### **Hybrid Mode** (intelligent switching)
- Low reality (0.1-0.3): Uses Core ML style
- High reality (0.7-0.9): Uses Templates style

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

**If Core ML generation fails:**
- Check console logs for "❌ GPT-2 generation failed"
- Model might not be compatible with my tokenizer
- Falls back to enhanced templates automatically

**If entries look the same:**
- Core ML might be using fallback templates
- The 645MB model might need different input format
- Check Settings → AI Engine → Model Status

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

✅ **Templates** feel authentic and messy like real journal entries  
✅ **Core ML** produces different (more flowing) text than Templates  
✅ **Custom prompts** work across all modes  
✅ **File import** successfully loads your test prompts  

## 📊 **Expected Results**

**Before (Old Templates):**
> "Today my coffee mug started giving me relationship advice. I'm not sure how to feel about this development."

**After (New Templates):**  
> "sarah texted me today. kinda annoyed but whatever... honestly need more coffee"

**Core ML (if working):**
> "Today I woke up feeling uncertain about the path ahead. There's something profound about these quiet morning moments when the mind wanders..."

## 🔄 **Next Steps After Testing**

If everything works:
- Optimize GPT-2 prompts for better journal-style output
- Add smart context system (recurring characters, ongoing situations)
- Implement comparison view for side-by-side AI mode testing

If GPT-2 fails:
- Debug the model input/output format
- Implement proper GPT-2 BPE tokenizer
- Consider using different Core ML model format

**Test it out and let me know what works and what doesn't!**
