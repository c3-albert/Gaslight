"Long Paragraph - Deep Thought","The concept of authenticity has been weighing on my mind recently. We're constantly told to ""be ourselves,"" but what does that even mean?

I used to think identity was fixed, something you discovered and then lived up to. But now I'm starting to suspect it's more like a story we tell ourselves, one that changes with each telling. The question isn't who am I, but who am I becoming, and do I like the direction of that transformation?","The concept of authenticity has been weighing on my mind recently.

"Long Paragraph - Experience","Yesterday I had one of those moments that makes you stop and really pay attention.

It struck me how much joy he was finding in this simple ritual, and I realized I couldn't remember the last time I'd been that present in a moment.","Yesterday I had one of those moments that makes you stop and really pay attention.
