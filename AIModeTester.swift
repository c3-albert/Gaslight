        # ðŸ“Š Analysis & Comparison
        
        ## Key Differences Observed:
        
        ### ðŸ”§ Templates Mode Characteristics:
        - **Style**: Whimsical, absurdist humor
        - **Length**: Short to medium (50-150 characters)
        - **Personality**: Quirky, unexpected object interactions
        - **Speed**: Instant generation
        - **Consistency**: Structured but varied through templates
        
        ### ðŸ¤– Core ML Mode Characteristics:
        - **Style**: Introspective, philosophical, thoughtful
        - **Length**: Long, detailed responses (200-400 characters)
        - **Personality**: Contemplative, existential, mature
        - **Speed**: 2-3 second processing delay
        - **Consistency**: More natural, human-like flow
        
        ### ðŸŽ¯ Hybrid Mode Behavior:
        - **Low Reality (0-50%)**: Uses Core ML â†’ Deep, philosophical responses
        - **High Reality (51-100%)**: Uses Templates â†’ Quick, creative responses
        - **Intelligence**: Adapts to user's desired "reality level"
        
        ## User Experience Impact:
        
        ### When to Use Templates:
        - Quick, fun journal entries
        - Creative writing prompts
        - When you want immediate results
        - For lighter, more playful journaling
        
        ### When to Use Core ML:
        - Deep reflection and introspection
        - Processing complex emotions or thoughts
        - When you want AI that "thinks" with you
        - For serious personal development journaling
        
        ### When to Use Hybrid:
        - Best of both worlds
        - Adapts to your mood via Reality Level slider
        - Surreal entries get philosophical treatment
        - Realistic entries get creative treatment
        
        ## Technical Performance:
        - **Memory Impact**: Core ML adds ~650MB when loaded
        - **Battery Usage**: Core ML uses more processing power
        - **App Size**: 646MB Core ML model included in bundle
        - **Offline Capability**: All modes work without internet
